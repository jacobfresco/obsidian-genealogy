# Templates for Obsidian and Templater for use with genealogy research
One of my hobbies is genealogy research; it has been a hobby since the early eighties. Back then, I had to write down everything or make a xerox of it (if even possible). Today, making notes and doing research is way easier when using a program like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). And especially when using the extremely powerfull plugin [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater``). Below are the templates I use almost exclusively in my genealogy-vault.

I have to apologise in advance; all texts are in Dutch (my native language)

## Templates
- [onderzoekstaak.md]: A template for a single research task. It allows for entering a title and tags and subdivides the note into several sections
- persoonskaart.md: A template for a single individual card. It allows for all details to be entered into frontmatter. This template relies heavily on both basis-persoonskaart and udpate-persoonskaart.md
- basis-persoonskaart.d: A template containing only the basis frontmatter for a persoonskaart. For example: if you receive notes from somebody else and need to update it to your own standard
- status-wijziging.md: A small template that allows to you to change the status of a note   created with the onderzoekstaak.md (frontmatter: status)
- update-onderzoekstaak.md: A template that allows you to insert the researchtask into existing notes
- update-persoonskaart.md: This is where the magic happesn. This template allows you to transform your individual cards into beautiful notes incorporating the frontmatter (basis-persoonskaart). You make it howver you want to,m it's yours
